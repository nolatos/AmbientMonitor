1. How would the model respond to sensor failures where the readings are missing or incorrect?
A: With the cross validation, we take a lot of readings, then take a median for the best corresponding values. Thus, anomalies like this would very likely not cause
much damage, unless there were a lot of it. In this case, it would be difficult to distinguish corrupt data from real data.

2. Are there any pieces of information missing that could help predict the conditions?
A: In my experience, I found the information such as raining and cloudiness has little impact on both temperature and humidity, thus I left them out in fear of 
overfitting the data. Personally, I think information such as outside temperature, or AC temperature, if applicable would be very helpful.

3. Can you think of any other changes or solutions the museum could explore to help keep the artifacts safe? 
A: Honestly, just don't let the visitors handle the artifacts. Just about every museum I've been to has a "no touching" rule.
